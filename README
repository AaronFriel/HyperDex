HyperDex is a distributed, searchable, and consistent key-value store.

In addition to supporting traditional GET/PUT/DEL key-value store methods,
HyperDex supports the GET_PARTIAL method which can efficiently search secondary
attributes (collectively the "values" of the store).

The key features of HyperDex:

 - Efficient GET_PARTIAL implementation which only contacts a subset of nodes.
 - Familiar table-like abstraction with rows and columns.
 - Strong consistency for GET/PUT/DEL operations.
 - Eventual consistency for GET_PARTIAL operations.
 - Automatic replica management, including recovery from failures.
