# hypergo

`hypergo` is a Go client for [HyperDex](https://github.com/rescrv/HyperDex).  This is part of my research project.

## Status

Work in progress.

## Credit

As the code currently stands, it's based largely on [hyperclient](https://github.com/tiborvass/hyperclient).  However this will change as I add more stuff.
